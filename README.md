# Maglev-Train: Study of the Lateral Stability of a Maglev Train

This repository presents the research project conducted during the PHY204 Classical Electrodynamics course at √âcole Polytechnique (Semester 4, Spring 2025). It investigates and compares the lateral stability mechanisms of two magnetic levitation train systems: **Electromagnetic Suspension (EMS)** and **Electrodynamic Suspension (EDS)**.

## üìö Abstract

Maglev trains levitate above their tracks using electromagnetic forces, enabling high-speed and low-friction travel. This project compares the **EMS system**, which relies on active stabilization via electromagnets and real-time control, with the **EDS system**, which uses superconducting magnets and passive repulsive forces from induced currents.

We developed both analytical models and Python-based simulations to explore the **lateral guidance stability** in each system. For EMS, we used magnetic circuit theory and the method of images with dipole approximations to derive force profiles and energy landscapes. For EDS, we modeled the full electrodynamic interaction between the train's moving magnetic dipoles and the guideway coils, simulating induced currents and time-averaged potential energy profiles.

Our findings show that:
- EMS systems exhibit **inherently unstable equilibria**, requiring active feedback control for stability.
- EDS systems exhibit **passive lateral stability at high velocities**, thanks to motion-induced currents generating restoring forces.

These results validate the underlying physics of modern Maglev designs.
